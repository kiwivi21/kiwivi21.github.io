Hello I'm Toby Tinker and I create vibrant and interesting artworks in 3D.  I am currently based in Christchurch, New Zealand and my primarily focus is 3D prop/environmental game assets. I aspire to work at companies such as CD Projekt Red. I am still a student but heavily developing my skills in and out of class with many different programs and styles and hopefully one day you can consider working with me.

My current educations is 
Level 5 Diploma in Animation (Yoobee School of Design), Level 6 Diploma in 3D Production (Yoobee School of Design) and I am 
currently working on Bachelors in Creative Technologies - Game Art (Media Design School)
