Hello I'm Toby Tinker and I create vibrant and interesting artworks in 3D.  I am currently based in Christchurch, New Zealand and my primarily focus is 3D prop/environmental game assets. I aspire to work at companies such as CD Projekt Red. I am still a student but heavily developing my skills in and out of class with many different programs and styles and hopefully one day you can consider working with me.
