Toby is incredibly reliable as a teammate, helpful with constructive feedback, attentively listening upon feedback, and most importantly is ALWAYS communicative throughout the process of the projects we have worked together with. Toby's exploration in VFX is always a treat to see, even better seeing the in-depth detailing of how the VFX are made, with his well crafted tutorials to follow along to. Toby's 3D art is I'd say his biggest strength, from constructing complex objects to the simplest, they are always cleanly built with highest quality checks and optimized to a T, and with the best textures he makes himself. Toby always makes sure to spend quality time on his work, and knows when to be efficient with his time.

Toby is a very pleasant person to work with. His work ethic not only shines through the projects that he develops, but through the teammates that he works with. He is a very motivated, hardworking individual that produces work at reasonable times whilst maintaining a high standard of quality. His time management is admirable as he is capable of distinguishing between differentiating priorities within his workload. Most notably, his work in 3D modelling, Texturing and VFX showcases his outstanding and unending knowledge of many software’s and engines.  He applies himself to many different programs as his determination and eagerness to learn is high. What I’ve noticed from Toby is that once he understands the program, he retains information incredibly well. Toby is a powerhouse of knowledge that I severely admire. Overall, Toby is a well-rounded developer that is a breath of fresh air to work with.
