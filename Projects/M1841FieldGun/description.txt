M1841 6-Pounder Field Gun
---
I had an assessment where I needed to create a portfolio piece and considering I focus on props I decided to work on a large asset as I haven't explored many large large objects in the past. I decided to work on a cannon as I found it had the scale and complexity to best show off what I have learnt throughout the modeling the workflow. The cannon I ended up deciding on was an M1841 6-Pounder Field Gun. This was used by the United States Army in wars such as the American Civil War.
